            <h2 class="topic">Pollution</h2>
            <p class="presentition"> Pollution is a term which even kids are aware of these days. It has become so common that almost
                everyone acknowledges the fact that pollution is rising continuously. The term ‘pollution’ means the
                manifestation of any unsolicited foreign substance in something. When we talk about pollution on earth,
                we refer to the contamination that is happening of the natural resources by various pollutants. All this
                is mainly caused by human activities which harm the environment in ways more than one. Therefore, an
                urgent need has arisen to tackle this issue straightaway. That is to say, pollution is damaging our
                earth severely and we need to realize its effects and prevent this damage. In this essay on pollution,
                we will see what are the effects of pollution and how to reduce it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pollution affects the quality of life more than one can imagine. It works in mysterious ways, sometimes
                which cannot be seen by the naked eye. However, it is very much present in the environment. For
                instance, you might not be able to see the natural gases present in the air, but they are still there.
                Similarly, the pollutants which are messing up the air and increasing the levels of carbon dioxide is
                very dangerous for humans. Increased level of carbon dioxide will lead to global warming.

                Further, the water is polluted in the name of industrial development, religious practices and more will
                cause a shortage of drinking water. Without water, human life is not possible. Moreover, the way waste
                is dumped on the land eventually ends up in the soil and turns toxic. If land pollution keeps on
                happening at this rate, we won’t have fertile soil to grow our crops on. Therefore, serious measures
                must be taken to reduce pollution to the core.
                <br>
                <br>
                After learning the harmful effects of pollution, one must get on the task of preventing or reducing
                pollution as soon as possible. To reduce air pollution, people should take public transport or carpool
                to reduce vehicular smoke. While it may be hard, avoiding firecrackers at festivals and celebrations can
                also cut down on air and noise pollution. Above all, we must adopt the habit of recycling. All the used
                plastic ends up in the oceans and land, which pollutes them.


                So, remember to not dispose of them off after use, rather reuse them as long as you can. We must also
                encourage everyone to plant more trees which will absorb the harmful gases and make the air cleaner.
                When talking on a bigger level, the government must limit the usage of fertilizers to maintain the
                soil’s fertility. In addition, industries must be banned from dumping their waste into oceans and
                rivers, causing water pollution.

                To sum it up, all types of pollution is hazardous and comes with grave consequences. Everyone must take
                a step towards change ranging from individuals to the industries. As tackling this problem calls for a
                joint effort, so we must join hands now. Moreover, the innocent lives of animals are being lost because
                of such human activities. So, all of us must take a stand and become a voice for the unheard in order to
                make this earth pollution-free.

            <h2 class="topic">Sound Pollution</h2>
            <p class="presentition">Noise pollution is a form of pollution which has become very deadly nowadays.
                This pollution is increasing only and creates an unsafe environment. Noise pollution is when the
                level of noise increases more than the normal level. When the amount of noise exceeds, it becomes
                dangerous for living beings. Moreover, these unpleasant sounds cause several disturbances and create
                an imbalance in the environment.

                In other words, high volume noises are abnormal. As the world is advancing at a rapid rate, so is
                noise pollution. Technology has made things easier for people by creating appliances and devices for
                almost everything. You want to mix or grind something? It can be done with a mixer and blender. You
                are feeling hot? Simply turn on the AC or cooler. Do you want entertainment at home? You can watch
                television or play music. However, people don’t realize this comfort comes with harmful effects too.
                All the mentioned appliances contribute to noise pollution. They disturb the natural rhythm of life
                and fall in the category of a pollutant.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the world is turning to technology for their comfort, it is, at the same time, harming us. The
                industries no matter how big or small contribution to noise pollution. The equipment they use like
                compressors, exhaust fans, generators and more produce a lot of noise.

                Similarly, the ever-increasing use of automobiles is a major cause of this pollution. Not only
                automobiles but other transport vehicles like airplanes, buses, bikes, trucks and more also are a
                part of it. People honk unnecessarily in the traffic and listen to loud music on the way which
                creates high levels of noise.

                Furthermore, social events like marriages, parties, and religious functions in places like clubs,
                pubs, temples, halls and more create a lot of nuisance in the residential areas. In addition, the
                construction activities like mining, the building of flyovers, bridges and more also produce great
                noise.
                <br>
                <br>

                Though it may not be talked about much, noise pollution has a serious impact on the lives of living
                beings. Firstly, noise pollution causes a number of hearing problems. High levels of noise damage
                the Eardrums and sometimes even cause loss of hearing.

                Similarly, it reduces the ear sensitivity to the sounds that the human body requires to regulate our
                rhythm of the body. Moreover, it also affects our psychological health. It may not be evident
                instantly, but in the long run, it changes our behavior.

                When your sleep gets disturbed or you constantly have headaches because of too much noise, you tend
                to experience fatigue and even migraines.

                Not only humans but noise pollution also impacts wildlife too. For instance, pets become aggressive
                or afraid when they hear a loud noise. It is one of the main reasons why crackers are not encouraged
                when pets are around.
                In short, we must make people aware of the impact of noise pollution. Likewise, we must encourage
                them to adopt ways that do not contribute to noise pollution. If everyone starts doing the same on
                an individual level, we will surely be able to reduce noise pollution to a great extent.

                <h2 class="topic">Water Pollution</h2>
                <p class="presentition">Water pollution occurs when water bodies are contaminated with various chemical
                    substances. Some of the most common sources of water pollution are factories, power plants, and
                    agricultural processes. Water conservation is an integral part of protecting the environment. Now
                    that we have understood the meaning of water pollution, let us know the reasons for water pollution
                    by reading the causes of water pollution essay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many ways in which pollution can be caused. Some of the most common causes include
                    industrial waste, pesticides, insecticides, fertilisers and deforestation. People contribute to the
                    problem by discarding anything they don’t want, like plastic bags and batteries, into the water
                    bodies. If you live near a factory or farm, it is essential to be mindful of what is being disposed
                    of and strictly follow the laws.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Water pollution is an environmental problem that has many effects. Water pollution causes the death
                    of plants, animals, humans and all other living beings. Fish and mammals may die off due to toxins
                    harmful to them, making it harder for wildlife to survive. In some cases, the pollutants found in
                    water can create an imbalance in the ecosystem, which negatively impacts plants and animals living
                    there. Moreover, this happens due to a lack of environmental awareness.Water pollution can causes
                    health problems, such as the increased risk of all types of cancer, respiratory and skin diseases,
                    disabilities, and heart diseases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Water pollution and environmental pollution is a widespread problem around the world. There are many
                    ways to prevent water pollution, but the most important ways are to avoid disposing of
                    non-biodegradable waste materials and industrial waste in water bodies, stop the usage of
                    pesticides, insecticides etc. These filters trap particles that may be harmful to humans, such as
                    chlorine and lead. They also filter out chemicals like fluoride, which can lead to cavities.

                    Another way to prevent water pollution is by ensuring no leaks in pipes or sewer lines and ensuring
                    that waste gets appropriately disposed of.

                <h2 class="topic">Inflation</h2>
                <p class="presentition">India’s food production crossed 235 million tonnes during years 2010-11 as per
                    the latest estimates and this is the highest since Independence. The previous highest production, at
                    nearly 233 million tonnes, was achieved in years 2008-09. Agriculture recorded a 5.4% growth in
                    years 2010-11 compared to the 4% growth achieved all these years, according to S Ayyappan,
                    Director-General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, inflation reflects overheating: the supply capacity of the economy is simply unable to
                    match the demands on that capacity. Moreover, purchasing power of consumers is increasing and hence
                    demand is accelerating. Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for agriculture have also been increasing. The
                    MSPs for various varieties of paddy during the years 2009-10 was between ₹ 950-980 per quintal and
                    during the years 2010-11, it increased to ₹ 1000 to 1030 per quintal.

                    <br>
                    Moreover, for pulses such as Arhar and Moong the MSPs in years 2009-10 was ₹ 2300 and ₹ 2760
                    respectively, while in years 2010-11, it increased to ₹ 3000 and 3170 respectively. Another major
                    cause of inflation is the increase in the prices of fuel internationally, which is contributing to
                    the overall price inflation. There has been a steady increase in the international prices, with the
                    Indian crude basket priced at $11 3.09 per barrel, as on May 2011. Any change in price of diesel
                    immediately impacts price of food items, since most of them are dependent on transport through
                    several 100 km. Inflation, in short, is “too much money chasing too few goods”. According to
                    analysts, corruption, mafia operations, greed for money by politicians and industrialists,
                    counterfeiting of currency notes etc., also contribute to corruption as they add to the availability
                    of liquidity in different forms, which in turn adds to inflation.

                    <br>

                    High level of inflation distorts economic performance. It has added pressure on the Central Bank to
                    raise rates despite signs of slow growth in the Indian economy. Thus, high inflation and rising
                    interest rates are crimping domestic demand and slowing down the economy. Inflation also affects
                    investment as higher long-term inflation adversely affects growth and investment. High inflation is
                    pushing up the cost of credit for firms as well as escalating their input costs by inflating their
                    spending on raw materials and wages. Corporate investment is affected by cost escalation of inputs,
                    and inflation is waning the confidence in the economic growth.

                <h2 class="topic">Women Empowerment</h2>
                <p class="presentition">Women empowerment refers to making women powerful to make them capable of
                    deciding for themselves. Women have suffered a lot through the years at the hands of men. In earlier
                    centuries, they were treated as almost non-existent. As if all the rights belonged to men even
                    something as basic as voting. As the times evolved, women realized their power. There on began the
                    revolution for women empowerment.
                    As women were not allowed to make decisions for them, women empowerment came in like a breath of
                    fresh air. It made them aware of their rights and how they must make their own place in society
                    rather than depending on a man. It recognized the fact that things cannot simply work in someone’s
                    favor because of their gender. However, we still have a long way to go when we talk about the
                    reasons why we need it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Almost every country, no matter how progressive has a history of ill-treating women. In other words,
                    women from all over the world have been rebellious to reach the status they have today. While the
                    western countries are still making progress, third world countries like India still lack behind in
                    Women Empowerment.

                    In India, women empowerment is needed more than ever. India is amongst the countries which are not
                    safe for women. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, women in India are in danger of honor
                    killings. Their family thinks its right to take their lives if they bring shame to the reputation of
                    their legacy.

                    Moreover, the education and freedom scenario is very regressive here. Women are not allowed to
                    pursue higher education, they are married off early. The men are still dominating women in some
                    regions like it’s the woman’s duty to work for him endlessly. They do not let them go out or have
                    freedom of any kind.

                    In addition, domestic violence is a major problem in India. The men beat up their wife and abuse
                    them as they think women are their property. More so, because women are afraid to speak up.
                    Similarly, the women who do actually work get paid less than their male counterparts. It is
                    downright unfair and sexist to pay someone less for the same work because of their gender. Thus, we
                    see how women empowerment is the need of the hour. We need to empower these women to speak up for
                    themselves and never be a victim of injustice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are various ways in how one can empower women. The individuals and government must both come
                    together to make it happen. Education for girls must be made compulsory so that women can become
                    illiterate to make a life for themselves.

                    Women must be given equal opportunities in every field, irrespective of gender. Moreover, they must
                    also be given equal pay. We can empower women by abolishing child marriage. Various programs must be
                    held where they can be taught skills to fend for themselves in case they face financial crisis.

                    Most importantly, the shame of divorce and abuse must be thrown out of the window. Many women stay
                    in abusive relationships because of the fear of society. Parents must teach their daughters it is
                    okay to come home divorced rather than in a coffin.
